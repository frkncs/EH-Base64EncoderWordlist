# Base64 Encoder with Wordlist

<b>Base 64 encoder for a bulk words. I needed this so I wrote one, if you need just use it</b>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
<code>python base_64_encrypter.py -t "source_wordlist.txt" -o "output_wordlist.txt"</code><br><br>
This tool will extract all the lines in your source list, encode every line and add every line's encoded version to the output wordlist.<br>
Simple but I needed that for some brute force thing, so you may need one.
